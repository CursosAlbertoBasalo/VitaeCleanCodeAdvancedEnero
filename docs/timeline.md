# Session 1 : Principles of Software Design

## Lesson 1.1 : YAGNI, KISS, DRY

## Lesson 1.2 : Obstacles for change

## Lesson 1.3 : Metrics, preventers and facilitators

- Reduce afferent (dependents) and efferent (dependencies) coupling

> `Payment`: 4 afferent dependents (not that many)

> `Bookings`: 8 efferent dependencies:

- Feature envy

> ?

- Inappropriate intimacy

> ?

- Primitive obsession

> `Trips.assertDateRange` and `Bookings.calculatePrice` : use a Range class with invariants and logic

- Reduce calls Tell Don`t Ask

> `Bookings.pay`: move to one method on `Payment`:

- Reduce knowledge with Law of Demeter

> `Bookings.notify`: don`t use emailComposer and.. TDA

- Command-Query separation

> `Payments.refundBooking`: is a command, not a query... related to TDA

> ðŸ’¬ Discussion: What about database Ids and create or post methods?
